Singapore's lamp posts are getting smarter. They don't just light the way â€” they watch over the pavements. Your next-gen chip has been selected for testing. Can your chip distinguish pedestrians from bicycles and PMDs (personal mobility devices)? Pass the test, and your chip will earn deployment on Singapore's smart lamp posts. Fail, and hazards roam free on pedestrian walkways.
